Kiwis love shopping around. We jump on TradeMe to find a bargain, cut out coupons from the morning paper, or make the most of the "price match" offers from retailers. One thing we're not so good at is shopping around for financial products. We usually take what the bank (who we've been with since we were 7 years old) offers us. We think this is because there's never been an easy way to compare financial products. We're here to change that. 

WalletMate is the simplest, fastest way to compare financial products in New Zealand. Whether you're looking for a new credit card to help earn airpoints, or wanting to take out a personal loan to 'put a ring on it', we want every Kiwi to jump on WalletMate first and make the best decision for themselves, rather than for the bank. You'll probably even save a few bucks along the way.

We're still young with lots of room to improve and grow. We hope you'll stick around with us throughout our journey, as we stick with you in your journey to making better financial decisions. If you have any questions, feedback, suggestions or comments, post them below. If you know anyone that might benefit from WalletMate, share our website with them. 

Cheers,  
Prashant & Santhan  
Co-founders | WalletMate
