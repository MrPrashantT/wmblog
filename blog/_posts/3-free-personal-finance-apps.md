In a world where Tinder and Snapchat filters and Pokemon GO (is anyone still playing that?) can be accessed on your phone with a casual flick of the finger, who really has time to be messing around with personal finance apps?

You. 

Yes, you.

Whether you’re working on paying off [your credit card](https://walletmate.co.nz/compare-credit-cards.html#/) debt or saving up for a winter escape to somewhere tropical, here are three of the best apps you should have on your phone:

1. Wally
--------

Wally is the perfect app for anyone who’s ever wondered where all their money goes (i.e. all of us).

The app provides detailed insight into your personal finances, and allows you to see not only how much money you spend, but also where you spend it and who you spend it with. Simply scan all your receipts and let Wally take care of the rest.

Available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=me.wally.android.plus&referrer=utm_source=website&utm_medium=home%2520download%2520page%2520button) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/wally-smart-personal-finance/id610314677?mt=8).

2. PocketSmith
--------------

PocketSmith is one of many modern apps that automates budgeting tasks by connecting directly to your bank account and using this data to help you track your spending and saving. 

The key difference is that PocketSmith was developed here in Aotearoa, and consequently actually works with local banks (unlike Level Money, PocketGuard, Qapital and a slew of other popular personal finance apps).

Track income and expenses, create cash projections and customise your budget to suit your lifestyle.

Available on [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/nz/app/pocketsmith-app/id1159515083); the [Android version](https://play.google.com/apps/testing/com.pocketsmith.mobile) is still in development.

3. Goodbudget
-------------

It might not have the most imaginative name, but Goodbudget is an excellent tool for families, flatmates, couples and anyone else who shares expenses. Set budgets for the various outgoings in your life (e.g. groceries, petrol, utilities, etc), create savings goals and sync it all across users and devices to ensure everyone’s on the same page when it comes to the household’s finances.

Available on [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.dayspringtech.envelopes&hl=en) and [iOS](https://itunes.apple.com/us/app/goodbudget-budget-planner-money-expense-tracker/id471112395?mt=8).
