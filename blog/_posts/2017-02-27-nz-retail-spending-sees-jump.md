Retail usually experiences some post-holiday blues, with economic activity typically taking a dive in January. This year, however, the slowdown hasn’t been so bad.

### Surprising rise in retail spend

Retail spend for January was up 5.6 percent from a year earlier at $5.13 billion, according to the most recent figures from Statistics New Zealand. 

This represents the largest percentage increase since January 2006.

While all six retail sectors enjoyed growth, the biggest gains were had by the fuel and hospitality industries, which increased 10 percent and 9 percent respectively.

Interestingly, [credit cards](http://walletmate.co.nz/blog/credit-card-5-tips/) had a huge role to play in this nationwide spending spree, with electronic card transaction sales up 5.6 per cent ($270 million) compared to January 2016. In fact, 49.6 percent of all retail spending in January was done on a credit card - a record high since Statistics NZ first began measuring this metric in 2002.

### Will the high-spend trend continue?

The impressive numbers came as a welcome surprise after months of stagnation in the retail sector. Westpac Banking Corp Economist Satish Ranchhod was hopeful that the trend would continue.

"Population growth remains strong, employment is up, and we continue to see strong tourist inflows,” commented Mr Ranchhod, as quoted by the NZ Herald.

"With interest rates still relatively low, and a range of other supportive factors in play, we expect that spending will remain firm for some time yet."

It’s too soon to tell if Mr Ranchhod’s predictions will come true. Regardless, with electronic card retail spending on the rise, it’s never been more important to have the right credit in your wallet.
